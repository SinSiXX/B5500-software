Transcriptions of Burroughs B5500 Mark XVI Listings

The following transcriptions are based on scans of listings available
from http://bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/B5000_5500_5700/listing/:

SYMBOL/ALGOL.alg_m
    Transcribed from B5700_Algol_Oct77.pdf by Nigel Williams, with
    proofing and corrections by Paul Kimpel. This source was later used
    as the base for /Unisys-Emode-Tools/xem/ALGOLXEM.alg_m.

SYMBOL/DCMCP.esp_m
    Transcribed from B5700_DCMCP_Sep77.pdf by Paul Kimpel.
    Note that as of 2016-05-01, this transcription has not yet been
    proofed.

SYMBOL/ESPOL.alg_m
    Transcribed from B5700_ESPOL_XVI_Dec76.pdf by Hans Pufal of
    Angouleme, France, with proofing and corrections by Paul Kimpel.
    This source was later used as the base for /Unisys-Emode-
    Tools/xem/ESPOLXEM.alg_m.

SYMBOL/FORTRAN.alg_m
    Transcribed from B5700_Fortran_Apr77.pdf by Fausto Saporito of
    Naples, Italy.

SYMBOL/KERNEL.esp_m
    Transcribed from B5700_Symbol_Kernel_May78.pdf by Paul Kimpel.

SYMBOL/TSSINT.esp_m
    Portions initially transcribed from B5700_TSS_Intrinsics_May77.pdf
    by Fausto Saporito of Naples, Italy. Then a customized and very
    impressive job of OCR conversion from the listing was done in
    December 2013 by James Markevitch at the request of Nigel Williams,
    which has replaced an earlier commit of Fausto's work. Note that the
    OCR conversion, while very accurate, is not perfect, so this file
    still needs to be proofed against the original listing.

PATCHES/ESPOL-116.txt
    Patches to SYMBOL/ESPOL.esp_m transcribed from B5700_ESPOL_Aug77.pdf
    by Paul Cumberworth of Adelaide, Australia.

PATCHES/ESPOL-PC-951.txt
    Patches to SYMBOL/ESPOL.esp_m by Paul Cumberworth of Adelaide,
    Australia that allow the compiler to be compiled under Mark XIII
    Algol.
