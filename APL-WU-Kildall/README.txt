    The source of the APL interpreter. This was transcribed from a
    photocopy of a listing donated by Ed Vandergriff of Chaska,
    Minnesota, US. According to Ed, this listing probably originated
    from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) in Atlanta,
    Georgia, US.

    Transcription was performed jointly by Hans Pufal of Angouleme,
    France and Fausto Saporito of Naples, Italy during August-September
    2013. Proofreading, corrections, and application of original
    sequence numbers was done in late 2016 by Richard Cornwell of
    Durham, North Carolina US.
