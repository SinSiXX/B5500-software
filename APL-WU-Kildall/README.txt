APL\B5500

APL interpreter for the Burroughs B5500, written by Gary Kildall (of
CP/M fame), Leroy Smith, Sally Swedine, and Mary Zosel at Washington
University (Seattle, Washington, US) in the early 1970s. This version
was modified by Jose Hernandez of Burroughs Corporation for operation
under the Timesharing MCP.

The source was transcribed from a photocopy of a listing donated by
Ed Vandergriff of Chaska, Minnesota, US. According to Ed, this listing
probably originated from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia
Tech) in Atlanta, Georgia, US.

Transcription was performed jointly by Hans Pufal of Angouleme, France
and Fausto Saporito of Naples, Italy during August-September 2013.
