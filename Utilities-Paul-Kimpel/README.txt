A collection of utilities and tools from the retro-b5500 emulator

Proofing-Tools/PDF-Listing-Column-Ruler.ppt
    A single-slide Microsoft PowerPoint 2000 document with a vertical
    grid that can be used to determine indentation and column alignment
    when transcribing or proofing listings. The grid can be printed on
    clear plastic (printable cells for overhead projectors work well)
    and used as an overlay for pages printed from a scanned listing.

    This grid has been designed to work with PDF compiler listings from
    http://bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/B5000_5500_5700/listing/
    when printed using a laser printer on ANSI-A (US Letter) paper. The
    grid may need to be scaled to work properly in other environments.
