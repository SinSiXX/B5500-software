R/C (Remote/Card) Interactive Source Editor for Burroughs B5500

R/C was written in the late 1960s by Ron Brody at Burroughs Defense,
Space, and Special Systems Group in Paoli, Pennsylvania, US. It had some
of the functionality of a timesharing system, but was not one. Unlike
CANDE, which had to run under the Timesharing MPC (TSMCP), R/C was
designed to run under the B5500 Data Communications MCP (DCMCP)
operating system. The datacom facilities of DCMCP were oriented towards
on-line transaction processing (OLTP) rather than multi-user
timesharing.

R/C provided for the remote preparation and maintenance of card-image
files, submission of card image files as batch jobs to the B5500 host,
and some remote control of those jobs. In that sense, it was more like a
Remote Job Entry (RJE) system, but one in which the card decks were
maintained on the central host rather than at the remote site. Output
from programs was generally printed or punched at the host, although
printer and punch files could be file-equated to disk and listed by R/C
from disk to the remote terminal.

The source files for R/C were transcribed from portions of
http://bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/B5000_5500_5700/listing/
B5700_Text_Editors_Sep76.pdf
by Rich Cornwell of Durham, North Carolina, US. Proofing and correction
of the source was done by Paul Kimpel.

RC-Compile.card
    A card deck that can be used to compile R/C from the RCSY94/RON
    source file.

RC-Reference.card
    A card deck that can be used to generate the R/C Reference Manual
    from TEACHER/0000094 using XREF/JONES.

RC-Reference.txt
    A text file of the output generated by XREF/JONES from
    TEACHER/0000094. This file contains ASCII form-feed (hex 0C)
    characters to mark page breaks.

RCIXGEN.PAUL.alg_m
    B5500 Algol program to scan the TEACHER/0000094 source file for
    *RCTEACH and *RCEND dummy control records that delimit the sections
    of text for the R/C TEACH command and rebuild the TEACH index
    records at the front of that file. The regenration of the index
    records is done in place using Algol update I/O.

RCSY94.RON.alg_m
    The R/C program, written in Burroughs Extended Algol.

TEACHER.0000094.txt_m
    The raw text of the R/C Reference Manual. This is coded in the
    markup notation used by the XREF/JONES utility, available on the
    Mark XIII SYSTEM tape. This file has not been transcribed from
    original markup -- Rich Cornwell reverse-engineered the markup for
    the first several sections from B5700_Text_Editors_Sep76.pdf;
    Paul Kimpel completed the reconstruction and indexing for use by
    R/C's TEACH command. Note that if lines are inserted or deleted in
    this source, the TEACH command index records in the front of the
    source will need to be regenerated on the B5500 by running the
    RCIXGEN/PAUL utility.

2016-05-21 P.Kimpel
    Completed and proofed TEACHER/0000094 and generated Reference Manual
    text file.
