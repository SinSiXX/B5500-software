Sudoku Solver: Paul Cumberworth

B5500 programs to solve Sudoku puzzles by Paul Cumberworth. He says this
about them:

    "It is still a little ragged around the edges - it is a port of the
    one from Michael Mahon's website.  I've also just got it running on
    the Elliott 803 emulator from Tom Sawyer, and I have passed it on to
    Peter Onion to try on the his emulator and maybe the Bletchley Park
    Elliott 803."

There are two programs, one in Extended Algol that uses a stream
procedure to count the bits in a word, and one in XALGOL (Compatible
Algol) that uses bit-wise Boolean logic. Otherwise, the two programs are
currently identical.
