Burroughs B5500-related utility programs for "Emode"

These programs are all written originally for the retro-b5500 emulator
project, to run under "Emode", the architecture for modern Unisys
ClearPath MCP systems. These systems are direct descendents of the B5500
through the B6500, B6x00/B7x00, and A Series systems.

The "xem" programs are B5500 compilers modified to run under Emode.
"xem" stands for "cross-compiled under Emode".

xem/ALGOLXEM.alg_m
    The B5500 Mark-XVI Algol compiler ported to Emode. It compiles B5500
    Algol programs (using the ASCII character substitutions established
    by retro-b5500) and generates binary B5500 object code. It is the
    full compiler, but does not implement merging CARD and TAPE source
    files, nor the CAST library mechanism. It compiles from the CARD
    file only.

xem/ESPOLXEM.alg_m
    The B5500 Mark-XVI ESPOL compiler ported to Emode. It compiles B5500
    ESPOL programs (using the ASCII character substitutions established
    by retro-b5500) and generates both binary B5500 code files and
    EBCDIC "card decks" as disk files. Like ALGOLXEM, it does not
    implement the full source input merging mechanism and compiles from
    the CARD file only.

B5500.POWTEN.alg_m
    Progrram to generate B5500 power-of-ten values in octal. The output
    of this program was used to proof the Mark-XVI Algol compiler
    transcription.

BICTOEBCDIC.alg_m
    Program to convert files coded using 6-bit BIC (B5500 Internal Code)
    to 8-bit EBCDIC. It was specifically designed to convert B5500 code
    files generated by ALGOLXEM and ESPOLXEM to a more readable form.

CODEDUMP55.alg_m
    Program to format a B5500 code file in octal to a line printer file.
    It also interprets the fields in Segment 0 and the segment
    dictionary. It was written to debug ALGOLXEM.

EMODE.POWTEN.dat_m
    Output from running B5500.POWTEN.alg_m on a Unisys LX100 server.

INCL2OMIT.alg_m
    Program to convert $INCLUDE and $OMIT pragmas in Mark XIII and
    earlier ESPOL source files to the newer $SET OMIT/$POP OMIT scheme
    used by Mark XVI and later compilers. This was written to allow the
    Mark XIII MCP source to be compiled with ESPOLXEM during early
    development of retro-b5500.

NEATUP.alg_m
    Prgram to reformat source code for Emode Algol originally written by
    Dave Brown of U.S. Customs in San Diego, California, and modified
    slightly by Paul Kimpel.

NEATUP55.alg_m
    A clone of NEATUP.alg_m, modified to reformat the transcriptions of
    the Mark XVI Algol and ESPOL compiler sources in preparation for the
    ALGOLXEM and ESPOLXEM portations.

NEATUP-ESPOLXEM.alg_m
    MCP CANDE "DO" file containing the NEATUP parameters used to
    reformat the ESPOLXEM source.

NEATUPINFO.alg_m
    Program to decode the "Lexicon" tables used by NEATUP. It was
    written as an aid to cloning NEATUP55 from NEATUP.
